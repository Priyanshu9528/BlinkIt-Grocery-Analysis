# BlinkIt Grocery Analysis

This project features an interactive dashboard that provides insights into BlinkIT's grocery sales performance, item categorization, and outlet distribution. The dashboard was created using **Power BI** and includes metrics such as total sales, average sales, outlet locations, outlet sizes, and customer ratings.

## Key Features of the Dashboard:
1. **Total Sales:** Displays the total sales value across all outlets and item types.
2. **Outlet Size:** Shows the distribution of outlets based on size (small, medium, high) and their respective sales contributions.
3. **Outlet Location:** Provides a breakdown of sales based on outlet locations categorized by tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
4. **Item Fat Content:** Analyzes sales based on the fat content (Low Fat vs Regular).
5. **Item Type Analysis:** Compares various item types such as fruits, snacks, canned goods, etc., in terms of sales and number of items.
6. **Outlet Ratings:** Outlets are rated based on customer feedback, with an average rating calculated per outlet.
7. **Sales by Year:** Displays the outlet establishment trends and how sales have evolved year-over-year.
